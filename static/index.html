	<h4>Project ID: 22806</h4>
	<p>You are invited to take part in this study.  Please read this Explanatory Statement in full before deciding whether or not to participate in this research.
	If you would like further information regarding any aspect of this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the phone numbers or email addresses listed in the footer.</p>
	
	
	<h4>What does the research involve?</h4>
    <p>The study will investigate how quickly people recognize what kind of information graphic they are looking at and its
        main components. This will inform our understanding of how data graphics are perceived and may also inform the
        design of &quot;glanceable&quot; visualizations such as those on a smartwatch which are designed to be understandable at a
        glance.

        In order to help us with this evaluation, you will be asked to complete a user study by using a computer<em> online and you can access the experiment from your home or wherever it is convenient</em>. The time the participants take to complete each task and their answers will be recorded with coded identification, i.e., Participant 1, Participant 2, and so on, in order to link the result of each experiment. No user name or contact details is recorded in any electronic data during the experiment. 

	You will go through the following steps:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Be shown a copy of the Consent Form and asked to agree if you wish to proceed.</li>
	<li>Answer a few questions concerning your experience with the graphics in the experiment and demographic questions about age, gender, and education. </li>
	<li>Be trained with the necessary background to understand these graphics and answer the questions in the study. </li>
    <li>Be shown a sequence of these graphics for short periods of time (1/10th of a second or less). After being shown each graphic you will be asked to identify the kind of graphic and answer a multiple-choice question about it.  </li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
	We expect that you will need about 20-30 minutes to complete this study.
	</p>
    
    
    <h4>What kind of graphs will be displayed for this research?</h4>
	<p>The kinds of graphics that will be used in the study are line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, and network diagrams. You should be familiar with these to take part in the study.</p>
    
    
	<h4>Why were you chosen for this research?</h4>
	<p>You responded to our invitation email to participate in this research.</p>
    
	<h4>Consenting to participate in the project and withdrawing from the research</h4>
	<p>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to complete the experiment. You will be sent this explanatory statement and consent form through Email after you contact us. You will also be emailed with an explanatory statement and consent form before the experiment starts. You will be asked to fill it and click on agree to provide your consent in the form if you wish to proceed. </p> 
	<p>The user study will be conducted online. All the digital data is collected using coded surveys, e.g., participant 1, participant 2, and so on. No user name or contact details are recorded in any survey or visualization task completion during the experiment, except the consent form which contains the name of the participant. An online demographic survey is used to collect background information of the participants (age, gender, degree, graph skill level, visualization skill level). During the experiment, participants are presented with visual representation images and asked to take on visualization tasks made of multiple-choice questions using a computer. At the end of each experiment, an online survey is used to collect their experience of the experiment and which visual presentation they preferred.</p>
    
	<h4>Possible benefits and risks to participants </h4>
	<p>The study is low-risk. However, because the participants will be presented with all the static images and visualization tasks from a computer monitor, there is a small chance that the participants may experience fatigue. In that case, we remind the participants that he/she can take a break or stop the session.</p>
	<p>By participating in the user study, you can help us understand the comprehension of the graphs when displayed for a quick glance. </p>
	<p>After completing the study, you will be eligible to enter a draw to win an AU$50 gift card as thanks for your participation. 
	At the end of the user study, you will have the opportunity to provide us with your contact details, including name of participant and email address. If you choose to do so, you will then have a chance to win a prize of AU$50. After the study is completed (within about three months), we will award an AU$50 gift card to a randomly chosen participant. Your contact details and identity will be kept confidential. You are free to not provide your details.</p>

	<h4>Payment</h4>
	<p>After the study is completed (within about three months), we will award an AU$50 gift card to a randomly chosen participant who has completed the user study and provided us name of participant and email address. Your contact details and identity will be kept confidential. You are free to not provide your details.</p>

	<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
	<p>The responses that you will give will be stored for the duration of our study. We will analyse the responses after we have collected all the responses from other participants. Thus, we will not use any personal information in the academic publications that will report the results of this study.</p>
	<p>All the digital data is collected using coded surveys, e.g., participant 1, participant 2, and so on. No user name or contact details are recorded in any online survey or visualization task completion during the experiment, except the consent form which contains the name of participant. </p>
	<p>At the end of the user study, if you choose to provide your contact information, you will then have a chance to win a prize of AU$50. Your contact details and identity will be kept confidential. You are free to not provide your details.</p>

	<h4>Storage of data</h4>
	<p>Storage of the data collected will adhere to the University regulations and kept on University premises in a locked cupboard/filing cabinet for 5 years, and/or on a secure computer. A report of the study may be submitted for publication, but individual participants will not be identifiable in such a report.</p>

	<h4>Results</h4>
	<p>Results from the user study may be published as a journal article or conference paper or in the book chapter. Results from the user study may be included in the Masters's thesis of the co-investigator (Akshay Sapra). Published results will be in a totally de-identified summary form. Participants may gain access to a pre-print electronic version of a journal article or conference paper after it will have been published. Participants may gain access to the electronic version of Akshay Sapraâ€™s Master thesis after it will have been published.</p>
