			    <h1 align ='center'> Real Question Set 2/3 </h1>
                <p> We will now show you 110 graphics for a short period of time, and ask to identify the graphic and the number of components in it, just like you did in the training.</p>
                <p><strong>Sometimes the graphics will only be shown for a very short time and you may not fell like you have seen them. Thats OK.</strong></p>
            <p><b><span style ="color:red">IF YOU ARE NOT SURE JUST MAKE YOUR BEST GUESS</span></b></p>
            <p>You can take a rest at any point in the experiment. You will also be given an opportunity to take a short break after every 50 graphics</p>
                <p> Each graphic will have two questions (similar to last set).</p>
                <ol>
                <li> You will be asked to identify <strong>the type of graphic. </strong></li>
                    <br>
                <li> You will also be asked to describe <strong>the number of elements </strong> like lines, clusters, bars, sections/slices in a graph.</li> 
            </ol>
            <li style = "text-indent : 5em;"> <span style ="color:red">sections or slices</span> in a <strong>Pie Chart</strong>.</li>
            <li style = "text-indent : 5em;"> <span style ="color:red">clusters</span> in a <strong>Scatter Plot</strong>.</li>
            <li style = "text-indent : 5em;"> <span style ="color:red">bars</span> in a <strong>Bar Chart</strong>.</li>
            <li style = "text-indent : 5em;"> <span style ="color:red">clusters</span> in a <strong>Node Link Diagram</strong>.</li>
            <li style = "text-indent : 5em;"> <span style ="color:red">lines</span> in a <strong>Line Graph</strong>.</li>

                <p>At the end of the study, if you agree to participate the prize draw, we offer a gift card of a randomly selected participant with good performance.</p>
